# Part 2: Walkthrough Tutorial

**Work with enterprise data sources and advanced controls.**

## Files in This Directory:

### Provided:
- `index.html` - Starter HTML template
- `js/main.js` - TODO comments guide you through implementation
- `css/styles.css` - Professional styling

### Your Task:

Follow the step-by-step instructions in the main [README.md](../../README.md) under **Part 2: Walkthrough Tutorial**.

Complete the TODO sections in `js/main.js` to:
1. Initialize the OpenLayers map
2. Add vector tile layer (MVT format)
3. Connect to WMS service
4. Implement layer switcher control
5. Add drawing tools

## Key Enterprise Concepts:

- **Vector Tiles (MVT):** Scalable, client-side rendered map data
- **WMS Services:** Server-rendered raster tiles from OGC services
- **Layer Management:** Professional UI for controlling data visibility
- **Drawing Interactions:** User-generated spatial content

## Getting Started:

1. Open `js/main.js`
2. Follow the TODO comments
3. Test frequently: `npm start` (from root directory)
4. Refer to OpenLayers documentation linked in code comments

Good luck! 🗺️
